ITDEV199 Integrated Project
------
### MATC Spring 2019

The Integrated Project course is a capstone project that reflects the student's culminating experience in the program.  In this course, students integrate their knowledge and skills in IT, reflect upon the work they have produced throughout their program, put their thoughts about their work into writing, demonstrate core ability skills, and display overall comprehension of their own discipline through the implementation, demonstration and documentation of the capstone project.  Students evaluate their learning based on the program's specific learning outcomes.
